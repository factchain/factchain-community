# factchain-community

See [Factchain Pitch Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SVDxzgBY_GsQRAT_anoVA7sfMu26-kKfJJI6M455bC0/edit?usp=sharing)

Decentralized notes, decentralized rewards. A collaborative approach to combating misinformation, block by block.

Contributors to Factchain Community can record notes about any social media post on the blockchain. If enough contributors from different viewpoints rate a note as helpful on the blockchain, the note will be displayed on factchain.tech, and on the Factchain browser extension.

- Notes & votes are permissionless. No central authority to trust.
- Transparent incentives for note writers & voters. Factchain rewards writers who create helpful notes & voters who identify helpful/misleading notes
- Factchain's truth layer works for any social media platform:
  - Factchain's browser extension adds FactChain notes on top of social media posts
  - Anyone can query the Factchain API for notes on social media posts
